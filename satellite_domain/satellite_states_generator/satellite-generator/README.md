This is a copy of [the IPC-2002 satellite problem generator](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/ipc2011-learning/Domains.html#Satellite), modified to fix a compilation error. On my machine, it now gives a warning but seems to compile and run correctly. 

To see how to use it, go to a command line and enter "satgen" with no arguments.
