# Comparative_Analysis_of_Domain_Independent_and_HTN_Planners

Implemented actions for Metric-FF and Fast Downward domain-independent planners in PDDL. Implemented actions and methods for HTN Planner using GTPyhop in the Block World State and Satellite domains.

Conducted a comparative analysis of the above-mentioned planners for various problem sizes and evaluated the performance of the planners using metrics such as the number of nodes explored, CPU time, and plan length.
